![IntroFig](./pages/figs/IntroFig.png)

### Course Description
Mass spectrometry based proteomic experiments generate ever larger datasets and, as a consequence, complex data interpretation challenges. This course focuses on the statistical concepts for peptide identification, quantification, and differential analysis. Moreover, more advanced experimental designs and blocking will also be introduced. The core focus will be on shotgun proteomics data, and quantification using label-free precursor peptide (MS1) ion intensities. The course will rely exclusively on free and userfriendly opensource tools in R/Bioconductor. The course will provide a solid basis for beginners, but will also bring new perspectives to those already familiar with standard data interpretation procedures in proteomics.

### Target Audience
This course is oriented towards biologists and bioinformaticians with a particular interest in differential analysis for quantitative proteomics.
